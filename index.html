        <h3>Hey! With over seven years of experience in the hospitality industry, I've honed my skills in various roles,
            each contributing to my expertise in culinary arts and kitchen management. <br> <br> Beginning as a kitchen
            helper in 2017, I quickly progressed to roles such as tandoor cook and Indian cook, where I developed a deep
            understanding of regional cuisines and cooking techniques. <br><br> Transitioning to a larger establishment
            in 2021, I further refined my abilities as a kitchen supervisor, overseeing operations and ensuring
            efficiency and quality in all culinary endeavors. <br><br> My internship at Trident, Bhubaneswar in 2022
            provided invaluable insights into professional kitchen operations, enhancing my leadership and
            organizational skills.<br> <br> Throughout my journey, I've remained dedicated to delivering exceptional
            culinary experiences and fostering collaborative environments for culinary teams.</h3>
